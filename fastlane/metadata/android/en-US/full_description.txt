Zemzeme is a private, serverless messaging app that works without internet, accounts, or central servers. It supports three independent transport layers that operate simultaneously:

- Offline Bluetooth mesh (BLE) — no internet needed
- Direct peer-to-peer via libp2p + ICE — over Wi-Fi or mobile data
- Nostr relay — internet-based fallback

All messages are end-to-end encrypted using the Noise Protocol (Curve25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305).

Features:
- Text messages with formatting and @mention support
- Voice notes, image, and file sharing
- Read receipts and delivery indicators
- Password-protected channels
- Geohash-based public channels (city to country granularity)
- Ed25519 signed QR codes for peer identity verification
- Biometric + PIN app lock
- 35+ languages supported

Forked from bitchat v1.7.0, extended with internet-capable transport layers built on libp2p.
